ok first create a repository in the home called program_sources

thend git clone the following: https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph.git

once done the best pratce is to check so run :
python -m pyqtgraph.examples
 
if it doesn't work (it problably won't) and you will get an error like:
agotelli@ProBook:~$ python -m pyqtgraph.examples
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 174, in _run_module_as_main
    "__main__", fname, loader, pkg_name)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/runpy.py", line 72, in _run_code
    exec code in run_globals
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyqtgraph/examples/__main__.py", line 159, in <module>
    run()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyqtgraph/examples/__main__.py", line 154, in run
    app = App([])
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pyqtgraph/examples/__main__.py", line 28, in __init__
    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
TypeError: super() takes at least 1 argument (0 given)




then run:
python3 -m pyqtgraph.examples

If it work so we are cool. If it doesn't work, that's because the package is in your computer but not installed. The problem should result in the following error:
agotelli@ProBook:~$ python3 -m pyqtgraph.examples
/usr/bin/python3: Error while finding module specification for 'pyqtgraph.examples' (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyqtgraph')


So let's install it:
sudo pip install pyqtgraph


then run again:
python3 -m pyqtgraph.examples


If it work so we are cool. If it doesn't work, that's because you're missing PyQt5, You may have in your 
OS but not installed, so let's install it: 
sudo pip install pyqt5


Ok at this point by running the command:
python3 -m pyqtgraph.examples

The tutorial should open istantaneusly. Then you can create the plot that you want.
