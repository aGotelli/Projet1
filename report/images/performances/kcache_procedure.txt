just by following the tutorial got the error:


RLException: Roslaunch got a 'No such file or directory' error while attempting to run:

valgrind --tool=callgrind --callgrind-out-file=callgrind.estimator.%p /home/agotelli/catkin_ws/devel/lib/simulation/simulation_file_handler /home/agotelli/catkin_ws/src/Project1/data/processed_errors loop_smooth __name:=file_handler __log:=/home/agotelli/.ros/log/8f02d088-b3a2-11ea-9a62-f4066972bee2/file_handler-4.log

Please make sure that all the executables in this command exist and have
executable permission. This is often caused by a bad launch-prefix.
The traceback for the exception was written to the log file


To install kcache 

sudo apt-get update -y

sudo apt-get install -y kcachegrind


and then try again launch file

ok got this :
