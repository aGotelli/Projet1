% Measurement noise.

sigmaXmeasurement = 5.6;%5.6 ;  % Determined by student
%Taking uniform distribution I will end with a result that does not
%prejudicqte where the magnet will be detected in the sensor, so by
%following the default formula for the variance i get deltaS divided by 12
%under square root so Sigmay = sqrt(deltaS^2/12) result is 5.6, we took 6

sigmaYmeasurement = 2.9 ;  % Determined by student
%same for X but in this case the result is 3
Qgamma = 1.1*diag( [sigmaXmeasurement^2 sigmaYmeasurement^2] ) ;
